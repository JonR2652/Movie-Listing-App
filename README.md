# Movie-Listing-App

This movie app is a browser-based app using html, css, JavaScript, Node.js, Express and SQLite3. It allows user to view a dynamically loaded and sortable list of movies which are stored in the SQLite3 database which is populated with test data.

Movie Listings Display
Fetches and displays movie records from a SQLite database, showing title, director, release year, and genre.

Sorting Functionality
Users can sort movies by:

Title (A–Z / Z–A)

Director (A–Z / Z–A)

Release Year (Oldest to Newest / Newest to Oldest)

Genre Filter Dropdown
A genre dropdown allows users to filter movies by genre. The dropdown is populated dynamically based on actual genre values in the database.

Responsive Layout
The layout adapts to all screen sizes using Flexbox and media queries. On desktop, sorting and genre controls are aligned side by side; on mobile, they stack vertically.
